**_-Intimacy and autism: an apparent paradox-_**

**_-Exploring it through aesthetic tools-_**

**_-Introduction-_**

**_-Is it possible for a therapist to become “autistic” when working with an autistic person?-_**

**_-The question is deliberately ambiguous.-_**

**_-The concept of emotional intimacy involves the idea of being open to others and on the same wavelength; on the other hand, autistic patients have a hard time dealing with relationships. For this reason, becoming “autistic” for a therapist is an emotional paradox: becoming “autistic” means seeking empathy with the patient, but also protecting-_** one**_-self, sometimes in an unconscious way, from contact with overwhelming feelings.-_**

**_-Maintaining/describing the paradox can be a valuable tool in psychoanalytic therapy.-_** 

**_-This paper is a research about what it means to bec-_**o**_-me “autistic” in the therapeutic process, in order to explore the autistic p-_**atient’**_-'s intimate mental relationships.-_**

T**_-hree features of thi-_**s process will be considered**_-:-_** 

**_-- specificity in body contact-_**

**_-- different ways to buil-_**d **_-meaning-_**

**_-- the possibility-_** of **_-interpretation through body performance-_**

**_-Container and proto-container: a theoretical hypothesis of processing experience-_** 

**_-Bion thought that-_** **_-cop-_**ing **_-with r-_**a**_-w emotions and sensitive impressions (β elements) first-_** requires **_-a mental function (alpha function) able to transform them into more meaningful elements (Bion 1962).-_**

Later**_-in his research, Bion hypothesized the existence of two types of β elements. The first ones, named “normal” β elements, are sensations and primitive emotions that can beevacuated-_** **_-for communicative and defensive p-_**ur**_-poses, and for this they require the mental-_** c**_-oncept of a container into-_** which **_-to project them.-_**

**_-The second type, β2 elements, have the property of aggregating and disintegrating like the former, but in such a manner as to produce a proto-container,-_**  giving **_-a sense of body integrity (Bion 1963, Cartwright 2010).-_**

**_-During development this second type tends to-_** e**_-volve and functioning container-contained is the most important way to process emotions.-_**

**_-We can hypothesize that in autistic people, whose minds-_** may not naturally **_-develop towards a relational way of functioning, the proto-container maintains an important function, and in some cases it is the only-_** **_-pervasive-_** **_-way to process the experience.-_**

**_-The use of repetitive gestures, described by Francis Tustin (-_**1972) **_-as movements use-_**d **_-by autistic children to build a sensitive shell-_**, **_-can be seen as gestures derived-_** from **_-a proto-container way to defensively process primitive emotions.-_**

**_-In the therapeutic relationship, the problem for the analyst is how to reactivate in himself a mental functioning that is almost disappeared, to try to realize with his patient an emotional consonance, the first step of almost all transformations. How-_** does one return **_-to processing r-_**a**_-w emotions through a proto-container?-_**

**_-The oscillation between different states of mind (Contiguo-_**-**_-autistic state-_**, **_-schizoparanoid state, and depressive state) has been-_** transcribed **_-by Grotstein-_** as **_-β ↔ (β2) ↔ α oscillation (Grotstein 1983, 2007).-_**

**_-So we can imagine that this oscillation is a way of functioning in every person and,-_** like **_-Bion, we are interested in the switch between these conditions.-_** 

**_-To explore the proto-container and the container-_**’s **_-primitive functioning-_** means **_-explor-_**ing **_-the-_** boundary **_-between body and mind to investigate the nature of the primitive way of processing the experience-_**, **_-the crossing of the line between columns A and B of Bion’s grid (Bion 1977).-_**

**_-Another problem in therapy with autistic patients is distinguishi-_**ng **_-when-_** **_-sensoriality is used in a defensive way or when it is the first attempt to communicate, or in other words, whe-_**ther **_-they are us-_**ing **_-container or proto-container.-_** 

**_-The use of proto-container and repetitive gestures produces a sense of impasse in the relationship, a feeling in the mind of the analyst-_** of **_-being kept out and the desire for them to go away.-_**  

**_-The lack of sense pushes a normal mind to run towards a subjective meaning and this fact opens a huge-_** **_-separation-_** **_-with an autistic patient. In some ways, the analyst and the patient are both in the same emotional withdrawal from the relationship.-_** 

**_-To go back to primitive functioning, necessary to reach the patient where he is, the analyst ha-_**s **_-to cope with his-_** **_-hate-_** **_-experience and transform this emotion into an aesthetic experience.-_**

**_-With the-_** term **_-aesthetic experience,-_** **_-I want to resume the complex working t-_**hrough **_-of the process-_** of **_-transforming the feeling of impasse and the analyst’s withdrawal from the relationship into an experience near body, sensoriality, and the creative process.-_** 

**_-Aesthetic experience is an experience that-_** lies along **_-the double arrow between β ↔ (β2) ↔ α oscillation.-_**

**_-Caravaggio and his painting “Boy bitten by a bumblebee”-_**

**_-In his famous painting “Boy bitten by a bumblebee”, Caravaggio depicts a young man whose face is-_** **_-deformed by pain.-_**

**_-The communicative effect is increased by the asymmetry of the face, and this-_** effect **_-is probably due to the optical lens w-_**hich **_-Caravaggio used-_** as a **_-drawing aid (Hockney 2001, Landi 2000, Lapucci 1994).-_**



**_-Figure 1: Caravaggio Boy bitten by a bumblebee 1593-_**

**_-The face in particular is the result of two different painting moments: one in w-_**hich **_-the boy is more frontal and the second more lateral. Indeed, the use of optical len-_**s **_-obliged the painter to realize the painting-_**, **_-dividing it into parts and then putting them together.-_** 

**_-In-_** a **_-way, this painting can be useful to illustrate-_** how the **_-bodily communication of sorrow between-_** a **_-normal and an autistic person can be-_** accomplished **_-starting from two different points of view.-_**

N**_-onverbal communication, especially with the face, is a common way to transmit emotions;-_** however, **_-autistic children don’t decode the emotional features of the face,-_** relying instead on **_-other parts of the body and repetition.-_**

**_-So the analyst and the child express sorrow in very different ways.-_**

**_-Caravaggio’s depiction reflects how an analyst can try to-_** recreate **_-in his mind the sudden pain that penetrates the relationship-_** like **_-a bumblebee’s-_** sting **_-when the child enters-_** a **_-loop of repetitive gesture. It can be hypothesized that the-_** beginning **_-of the loop is a painful sensation difficult to-_** **_-discover-_** **_-and transform into emotion.-_**

**_-So the analyst needs-_** to **_-first put together the different ways to p-_**erceive **_-and then,-_** like **_-a painter using-_** a **_-lens, transform it into a mental image. Images are more-_** effective **_-than words-_** for **_-reaching autistic children.-_**

**_-Before-_** **_-giv-_**ing **_-a clinical example of this type of transformation in w-_**hich **_-the line between two ways of exper-_**i**_-en-_**cing **_-pain is an important place of transformation, I-_** will **_-explain how this technical tool ar-_**i**_-ses.-_** 

**_-The background-_** **of** **_-learning to see from another point of view-_**

**_-The first step that deeply changed the sight of some relational features with an autistic child c-_**a**_-me in my mind after-_** I **_-participat-_**ed in **_-an artistic experience-_**, **_-a sort of sensorial calligraphic experiment. As for Steve Jobs-_** a **_-calligraphy course was the starting point for a new logical-_** **_-organisation-_** **_-of the Mac screen, th-_**is **_-artistic course on tactile experience was for me the-_** starting **_-point of a new way to look at my patient’s productions (Isaacson 2011).-_**

**_-Each participant was blinded and then had to put her hand into ten different bags containing unknown materials: little round stones, moss, broken tiles,-_** feathers, **_-and so on.-_**

**_-With the other hand each had to-_** draw**_-, on a square piece of cardboard,-_** the **_-transformation of the tactile experience into the graphic one. To allow a more accurate translation from a sense to-_** shapes**_-, the participants c-_**ould **_-use the rough or smooth side of the cardboard and choose – without-_** looking **_-- charcoal, pencil with hard or soft-_** lead, **_-or a graphite stick.-_**

 

**_-At the end of the experiment,-_** after removing their **_-blindfolds, they can see the ten pieces of cardboard-_** in **_-the same format, as a tactile/signs musical arrangement. They are different-_** from **_-each other-_**, **_-but also deeply linked from the sensorial origin.-_**  

**_-In the single cardboard we can observe-_** how**_-,-_** without **_-sight, we can go back to a stage in w-_**hich **_-touching and hand movements are very close-_** to **_-imagination, not a symbolic imagination but a sensorial one.-_**



					**_-Figures 2 and 3:-_** S**_-igns of Broken-_** T**_-iles and Moss-_**

**_-Bringing this experience into the therapeutic room and observing, for example, the repetitive gesture of touching-_** an **_-object or pushing a-_** toy **_-car back and forth, I learned to recall in my mind this experiment and ask myself what I was ‘touching’ with my senses but not with my sight.-_** 

**_-Then I try to reproduce with my fingers or with the whole body a movement that is a mix of something of patient’s gesture and my sensation.-_**

**_-The movement-_** **_-realises-_** **_-something more symbolic and not symbolic in the same time; something simple like a sign not a word or a drawing.-_**

At **_-the same time, my gesture isn’t a simple mirror of the chil-_**d's**_-; in the analyst-_**’s **_-mind the movement-_** blends **_-sensation and a first attempt-_** at **_-transformation.-_**

**_-So I-_** **_-put myself on-_** **_-the line between the patient's sensorial word and my need to transform it into a meaningful fact. I noticed that, with autistic children-_** as **_-with other-_**s**_-, I ha-_**ve **_-always tr-_**ied **_-to look at repetitive actions, drawings and movements as potentially meaningful situations.-_** 

**_-This is no-_**t **_-always good because an autistic child can-_** feel he is being **_-forced and respond by-_** strengthening **_-his-_** **_-defences-_****_-.-_**   

**_-So I try to put together primitive attempts to communicate-_** the **_-feeling and the sensory, saying for example-_**, **_-“-_**T**_-his movement (-_**bringing **_-my and patient-_**’s **_-gestures together) stings,” or “-_**T**_-his gesture is soft-_**;**_-” “You and-_** I **_-are doing this gesture to show fear.”-_**

**_-Sometimes I can add an image using my reverie: soft and terrible as a snake, or stings-_** like **_-a b-_**ee**_-.-_**

**_-I observed that this technical tool that I call “gesture in the middle” reduces the time in w-_**hich **_-the patient is able to-_** emerge from **_-repetition and together we can see something in a more symbolic way.-_**

**_-In the artistic experiment, I had also the opportunity to front and transform a difficult feeling linked to more primitive sens-_**e like **_-touch. The experiment takes an hour, and-_** though **_-in the beginning I feel excited and curious, after some time it is not-_** easy **_-to accept sight deprivation.-_**

**_-So I became more sensitive to the anxious arous-_**al **_-in me when an autistic child forces me to use a more primitive type of sens-_**ation, **_-forcing me to put aside the meaning that my sight suggests.-_**

**_-Step by step-_**, **_-I learned-_** to **_-transform a patient's repetitive gesture into a “middle gesture” and to accept the terrifying feeling that arose in the field. This step ar-_**o**_-se t-_**hrough **_-an active interest-_** in **_-performance-_** art**_-, in particular th-_**at **_-of Marina Abramović.-_**

**_-The performance: a-_** **way to** **_-integrat-_e** **_-of gesture and feeling-_**

**_-In the psychoanalytic treatment of an autistic patient, the therapist goes through experiences-_** in which **_-she risks-_** becoming **_-mired-_** **_-(Tustin 1994 a, Durban 2014).-_** Working **_-through the feeling of being bullied and-_** transforming **_-it into a feeling of trusting surrender is the first step of the transformative process. Then, this first emotional transformation in the therapist needs to become something that can reach the patient (Beebe, Lachmann, Jaffe 1997, William 1999, Molinari 2014).-_** 

**_-Tustin described autism “as a sensation-_**-**_-dominated state in w-_**hich **_-perception is elementary, restricted or grossly abnormal” (Tustin 1972 p.107) and qualified it as perverse.-_**

**_-This-_** way **_-of process-_**ing **_-reality brings the autistic child to build an “adhesive-at-oneness” relationship in w-_**hich **_-there is empathy and awareness of separation.-_**

**_-She suggested that if autism is a wordless illness, it needs to be treated without words (Tustin 1994b, p. 121), and transformation needs to be expressed through action. What type of action?-_**

**_-Houzel (1997) writes that when he was in supervision with Tustin he had the impression she “was thinking with her whole body” (p. 344). After listening, she moved her hands, arms, and body before talking, as if thinking arose not from the head but-_**in **_-the body.-_**

**_-So Tustin p-_**rovided **_-evidence-_** that **_-thoughts and emotions (etymologically, something that-_** “moves outward”**_-)-_** come from bodily sensations**_-.-_**

 

**_-Performance is a form of art that implies the active involvement of the audience, and the relationship with the viewers is not established by the object but by the artist’s body itself. Unlike artists who perform in front of an audience, such as dancers or actors, the perform-_**ance artist **_-does not know the final outcome of their interaction, as it is open to the unpredictable contribution of the audience. In performance art, it is the body that conveys emotions and meanings in an unstable balance between the creative intuition at the base of the piece and the unpredictable response of the audience that makes the artwork concrete.-_**

Performance artists **_-have a very special relationship with the audience and need to practice surrenderi-_**ng **_-in the presence of the other, integrating the other into their mind and actions without being overwhelmed. The performance does not aim to-_** close **_-the gap between artist and audience by means of an object loaded with meaning, but opens up the possibility-_** of maintaining **_-an empty space where the contributions of the spectators create a link that crosses it.-_**

**_-So in-_** a work of **_-performance art, the distance between the actor and people-_** experiencing it is **_-different from all other artistic situations ( Danckwardt,Wegner, 2007, Giannacchi et al 2012).-_**

**_-In a therapeutic session with an autistic patient, the analyst ha-_**s **_-to tolerate bodily contact, sometimes upsetting contact, trusting to find in himself-_** a **_-trace of meaning.-_**

**_-Touching and smelling as danger-_-_-mired situation-_** 

**_-During a summer session, I-_** was **_-wearing sandals. Charles-_**, **_-a-_** five-year-old **_-autistic child,was-_** looking down at my painted toenails**_-. He l-_**ay **_-down on the carpet and smelled my feet. I-_** was **_-very embarrassed and helped myself by thinking-_** of how **_-animals buil-_**d **_-odor maps to recognise sites, as-_** does **_-the newborn. He touched my feet, wanting to-_** pull off **_-the sandals, and even-_** though **_-I-_** tried to stop him**_-, he put his face on it, trying to explore-_** it **_-with-_** his **_-mouth. I fe-_**lt like I was **_-in a nightmare. At th-_**e **_-time, I-_** had **_-another patient with perverse symptoms, and this was probably an important association that-_** magnified **_-my difficulties.-_**

**_-In their 1977 performance,-_** **_-Imponderabilia, Abramović and her boyfriend Ulay stood, naked, as human doorposts on either side of the narrow entrance to the Galleria Comunale d’Arte Moderna in Bologna, Italy. The narrowness of the space forced visitors to squeeze sideways between them, forced to choose whether to face the naked Ulay or naked Abramović in order to enter the museum.-_**

**_-As in this performance, I want to go on and enter in a symbolic place (the art museum) but I have to pass t-_**hrough **_-two “naked bod-_**ies**_-”: my feet and the child smelling them represent a very tight door (Demaria 2004).-_**

**_-The only idea coming-_** to **_-my mind is the possibility-_** of **_-transforming my emotions,-_** overcoming **_-a primitive-_** recoil from **_-body contact and describ-_**ing **_-my experience to the child in another way. So I forced myself to take-_** off **_-my shoes and, using red-_** ink, **_-I ma-_**d**_-e some imprints of my feet on a large sheet of paper put on the floor. Charles follows me, starts to make imprints with-_**his **_-hands, then we together make squiggles with ou-_**r **_-feet and hands, entering-_** **_-in-_** this **_-way our personal-_** art **_-exposition.-_**

 

**_-A different way to process space and time-_**

**_-The same artistic experiment that I referred to earlier also g-_**a**_-ve me occasion to change my mind about the link between different actions during the session.-_**

**_-The products of the experience were ten little squares-_** marked **_-with different signs but linked together by the size, the form of the paper, and the working through. I saw them as a sequence, like a musical score or-_** frames **_-from a movie.-_** 



**_-Figure 3: sequence of tactile signs like a musical score-_**

**_-After the artistic experience, I was more able to see-_**how **_-different actions are linked together-_** by **_-the same shape and the same process-_** of **_-transforming different sensations; in the therapeutic situation with the autistic child, I begin to-_** look for**_-what type of experience the child was exploring, broken into different actions. Sometimes a global experience can occupy the whole hour even if pieced in parts in which the child uses different senses and makes different sequences of motion.-_**

**_-Often the use of the defensive shell arises around the exploration of dangerous edges like continuity-discontinuity, presence-absence, or attracti-_**on**_--repulsi-_**on**_-, and the child can-_** spend **_-the whole hour-_** emerging from **_-this terrifying feeling.-_**

**_-Charles and the variable accuracy of the shape-_**

**_-In the following clinical vignette I describe-_** how **_-an autistic child, five years old, communicates something of his experience by putting the same anguished feeling in different situations.-_** 

 **_-many child-_** **_-with autistic spectrum disorder, my patient use-_** **_-equivalency-_** **_-of his body and mind-_** **_-putting his-_** **_-sensation-_** **_-outside; equivalency replace-_** **_-identifications as a primitive method of relati-_** **_-(Tustin 1987, Mitrani 1998, Lombardi 2008).-_**

**_-To-_** **_-this case-_** **_-the analyst ha-_** **_-to change his perception of spacetime to-_** **_-near that of an autistic child-_** **_-that is very different from normal children.-_** 

**_-While-_** **_-space is more connected to-_** **_-biological experience of sight and movement,-_** **_-time is an abstract concept.-_** **_-ubjects affect-_** **_-by autistic spectrum disorder have problems-_** **_-memory (Rhode 2012)  **_-evident consequence of a different way-_** **_-perceiv-_** **_-facts in the time-space frame. Not always-_** **_-they-_** **_-experience-_** **_-the passing-_** **_-time because they are concentrat-_** **_-on-_** **_-space as a sequence of scenes linked not by time but by other logic (Bick 1968, Alvarez, A.1999, Busch de Ahumada, Ahumada 2017 ).-_**

 **_-with an autistic child  **_-not only wrds but also-_** **_-way of-_** **_-linking is useful. For an autistic child, I hypothesize that sometime-_** **_-all the different situations can be hardlinked-_** **_-to-_** **_-other-_** **_-not by something in the relationship, in the meaning, in the flow of emotions, but by the fluid shape of the edge between-_** **_-reality and its sensorial perception (Alvarez, 2010).-_**

**_-A fine disregard-_**

**_-During a session-_** **_-Charles takes a paper tube and start-_** **_-to make noises-_** **_-with-_** **_-sticks. He notices that-_** **_-the point-_**  **_-a broken line was repaired with-_** **_-, the sound is different. He repeats the sequence many times.-_**

**_-Then he draws a snail and after many trials on different sheets, he divides the spiral into sections. He starts to color the drawing  **_-not to-_**  **_-and when-_** **_-thappens the child stops and looks very distressed. He begins to use his tongue tothe traces of colour on his fingers like a little cat.-_**  

**_-Then he push-_** **_-me to hide myself behind-_** **_-the tent-_** **_-and if-_** **_-I go-_** **_-out-_** **_-he push-_** **_-me-_** **_-again. He doesn’t look into my eyes-_** **_-but he uses my body-_** **_-for that-_** **_-it isn’t a real hiding and seeking game.-_**

**_-When I tell him that the time is almost over,-_** **_-he-_**  **_-a box of marbles.-_**

**_-He want-_** **_-to put-_** **_-all the marbles-_** **_-into-_**  **_-box, dividing and alining them and saying that they are cookies.-_** 

**_-It is very difficult to end the session.-_**  **_-he-_** **_-react-_** **_-to my words or-_**  **_-type-_** **_-of interaction. Now he opposes-_** **_-the end **_-active resistance.-_**

**_-It became more evident to me that, during the session, I tried to give-_** **_-to-_** **_-different situations-_** **_-catching the emotions and saying something with simple words that are-_** **_-near-_** **_-as possible to the meaning of the different actions observed.-_** 

**_-So I start to become able to shift from-_**  **_-sense to another (something like-_** **_-rans-modal perception in-_** **_-newborn) and see the different sequences fuse together and link-_** **_-each other from something that I never understand. I start to imagine that the link could be in the shape-_** **_-a “global experience” explored with different senses.-_**  

**_-The first shape in my mind useful to describe them-_** **_-continuity-discontinuity-_** **_-in-_** **_-sound (the tube), in-_** **_-be-dimensional space (the shell)-_** **_-on the skin (the colour on the fingers)-_** **_-in the room (hide and seek) 

**_-So I hypothesize that at the end of the session the separation was impossible to-_** **_-front not for the emotional sorrow. The disturbing mix and the order-_** **_-stay in the place of the emotional experience as a concrete-_** **_-confusing experience.-_** 

**_-Charles didn’t want to stop. The next patient rang the bell. I went to open-_** **_-and then went-_** **_-in-_** **_-the therapy room. I had two possibilit: to oblige in a sort of “violent” way the patient to go away-_** **_-or to invent something that-_** **_-describe the situation and help-_** **_-finish.-_**

**_-In few seconds I thought that each sequence had been like a “sensorial selfportrait”-_** **_-that-_** **_-primary communicative intention and I can be in an intimate communication with him through my body performing the primitive meaning of continuity-discontinuity.-_** **_-As-_** **_-birth, life-_** **_-and death are strictly linked in the body experience, so can-_** **_-the birth of meaning.-_**

**_-To use my body to mirror his experience-_** **_-I had-_** **_-to-_**  **_-“cancel”-_** **_-meaning and emotions-_** **_-and return-_** **_-contact with very primitive-_** **_-disturbing sensations.-_** 

**_-I thought that the feeling was the tension-_** **_-between abandonment and control.-_**

**_-So I put myself in-_** **_-towards him,-_** **_-through the objects-_** **_-and made-_** **_-the same gesture-_** **_-with the tube, the pencil, the tongue and so on,-_** **_-to represent mirroring. I feel myself rally desperate,-_** **_-buried by the objects.-_**

**_-Then I l-_** **_-down-_** **_-like a baby or a dead person, take all the objects and put them over me and sa-_** **_-him-_**

**_-“It is the end. All are going away, but it is no-_** **_-easy; it is like go-_** **_-down like the marbles into a big confusion”-_**

**_-Charles sa **_-“OK”-_** **_-and-_** **_-quickly-_**  **_-the session.-_**

**_-When I was able to reflect, I thought that I tried to communicate to Charles how I could have understood the huge distance between us and between “be” and “not to be”.-_**  

**_-I thought that I had made something like Marina Abramović in-_**  **_-performance-_** **_-“Cleaning that mirror” **_-she scrubs a grime-covered human skeleton on her lap. In some way I want to show to Charles-_** **_-I-_** **_-have-_** **_-difficulty buried-_** **_-in **_-different actions; the end of the session confronts him not with the psychic sorrow of separation-_** **_-but with the interruption of his attempt to control falling down-_** **_-the black hole of confusion.-_**

**_-Conclusion-_**

**_-Analytical proximity-_** **_-or intimacy-_** **_-include-_** **_-a capacity to experience and give meaning to primitive state-_** **_-of being and emotions.-_**

**_-Autistic children defend themselves from primitive anxieties using mimicry, psychic equivalency, suspension-_** **_-and dismantling; these defences-_** **_-create-_** **_-a distance between action and meaning-_** **_-but also the collapse of the vital bodymind unit.-_**

**_-So starting from the point that body is-_** **_-the ‘not thinking’ side of mindbody system, the analyst put her body and action on the line of-_** **_-cracking-_****_-, trying to build a bridge trough the body participation of the child and the meaningful use of her-_** **_-body. The “middle gesture”-_** **_-like the artistic performance,-_**  **_-only with the participation of the patient and create-_** **_-a primitive form of body communication. In the ‘middle gesture’-_**  **_-the first transformation that the analyst ha-_** **_-made in herself of the negative feeling-_** **_-that permeate the relational field during repetitive gestures;-_** **_-in some way there is also the renunc **_-words, trusting-_** **_-first in the communicati-_** **_-power of the body.-_**

**_-Becm-_** **_-autistic with an autistic person may open a way to introduce a variation of psychoanalytic technique: the use of the body as lens and mirror to draw the first signs (as Caravaggio) allow-_**  **_-the body of the patient and the analyst-_** **_-on the same plane, even if-_** **_-two different point of view. The use of-_** **_-movement impregnated with emotions is useful to pass from bidimensional to tridimensional prspective, from proto-contaiment to effective containment: the analyst, as the artist, ha-_** **_-in her mind the meaning of his gesture, but it-_** **_-cme-_** **_-alive only with the patient-_** **_-participation.-_**

**_-The response of the patient is-_** **_-evidence of a new form of intimacy, a transitional intimacy between body and mind.-_**
